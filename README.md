# cpp-opencage-geocoder
A modern C++ library to access the OpenCage geocoder.

## Features
Coming soon.

## Installation
Build is via CMake, and requires a C++11-compatible compiler. The main dependency is the [C++ Requests](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr) library, which is added via a git submodule. C++ Requests has a few of its own dependencies, including libcurl.

## TODO
* Make build backwards-compatible with older CMake versions.
* Integrate C++ Requests submodule into CMake build.
* Implement geocoding.
* Implement reverse geocoding.

## License
