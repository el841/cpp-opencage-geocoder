# cpp-opencage-geocoder
A modern C++ library to access the OpenCage geocoder.

## Features
Coming soon. In a nutshell, geocoding and reverse geocoding.

## Installation
Build is via CMake, and requires a C++11-compatible compiler. The main dependency is the [C++ Requests](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr) library, which is added via a git submodule. C++ Requests has a few of its own dependencies, including libcurl.

## TODO
### Functionality
* ~~Implement geocoding.~~
* ~~Implement reverse geocoding.~~
* Implement alternative output formats (XML).
* Add more geocoding options.

### Build
* Make build backwards-compatible with older CMake versions.
* Integrate C++ Requests submodule into CMake build.
* Tidy build outputs.
